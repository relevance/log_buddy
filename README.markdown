# LogBuddy

## DESCRIPTION

log_buddy is your friendly little log buddy at your side, helping you dev, debug, and test.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/relevance/log_buddy.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/relevance/log_buddy)

## SYNOPSIS

Require the init.rb file to use log_buddy.  By default, it will add two methods to every object at the instance and class level: "d" and "logger".  To use log_buddy without the automatic object intrusion, set ENV["SAFE_LOG_BUDDY"] = true before requiring the init.rb.

You can use your own logger with LogBuddy by passing it into init's options hash:

    LogBuddy.init :logger => Logger.new('my_log.log')

Now you have your logger available from any object, at the instance level and class level:

    obj = Object.new
    obj.logger.debug("hi") # logs to 'my_log.log'
    class MyClass; end
    MyClass.logger.info("heya") # also logs to 'my_log.log'

You also have a method called "d" (for "debug") on any object, which is used for quick debugging and logging of things while you are developing.
Its especially useful while using autotest.  When you call the "d" method with an inline block, it will log the name of the things
in the block and the result.  Examples:

    a = "foo"
    @a = "my var"
    @@bar = "class var!
    def bark
     "woof!"
    end

    d { a }      # logs "a = 'foo'"
    d { @a }     # logs "@a = 'my var'"
    d { @@bar }  # logs "@@bar = 'class var!'"
    d { bark }   # logs "bark = woof!"


See examples.rb for live examples you can run.

##OPTIONS

When you occasionally want to disable LogBuddy (but you don't want to have to remove all your debug statements), you can pass the :disabled option into init's options hash:

	LogBuddy.init :disabled => true

If you have problems spotting your debug calls in the mess of other log entries, set use_banners to true. This will insert a newline and a row of 80 '#' symbols above and below your calls to make them much more obvious in long log files.

    LogBuddy.init :use_banners => true

## REQUIREMENTS

* Ruby 1.8.7 and greater or JRuby

## ISSUES

* This is meant for non-production use while developing and testing --> it does stuff that is slow and you probably don't want happening in your production environment.
* Don't even try using this in irb.

## INSTALL

	gem install log_buddy
